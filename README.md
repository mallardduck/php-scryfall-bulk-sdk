TODO: Add badges later

## Purpose

A PHP library designed to simplify working with Scryfall's bulk data.

## Requirements

# TODO
 - [ ] Consider adding first class exceptions
 - [ ] Pick/find a streaming JSON parser that emulates jq?

 - [ ] Make better debug code that would more accurately emulate realy usage.
